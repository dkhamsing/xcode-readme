# xcode-readme

Are you sad when you see [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) spelled xCode in a README? :sob:

Don't be sad, just `xcode-readme` it! :smile:

```
$ bundle exec xcode-readme https://github.com/rnpm/rnpm

Checking rnpm/rnpm ...
Whoa look how they wrote "Xcode" ðŸ”´
1. Why? Tooling is important. We all know this. One of the biggest advantages of native iOS development is XCode and its great tools. Unfortunately, the process of adding native dependencies to React Native projects is far from perfect and our aim is to make it fun again.

```diff
 FutureKit uses Swift generic classes, to allow you to easily deal with asynchronous/multi-threaded issues when coding for iOS or OSX.

-- is 100% Swift.  It ONLY currently supports Swift 2.0 and XCode 7+.  Swift 1.2 branch wont be supported anymore. (Too many issues with generics made swift 1.2 less than perfect)  We are also only supporting swift 2.0+ compatble SDKs (iOS 8.0+, OSX 10.x.)

 - is type safe.  It uses Swift Generics classes that can automatically infer the type you wish to return from asynchronous logic.  And supports both value and reference Swift types (Both 'Any' types, and 'AnyObject/NSObject' types.)

-- works well editing code within XCode auto-completion.  The combination of type-inference and code-completion makes FutureKit coding fast and easy.

 # Documentation

-FutureKit documentation is being written as XCode Playgrounds.  The best way to start is to open the FutureKit.workspace and then opening the Playground inside.  (If you open the Playgrounds outside of the workspace, then FutureKit module may not import correctly).
-The XCode Playgrounds probably require XCode 6.3 (in order to see the Markup correctly)
